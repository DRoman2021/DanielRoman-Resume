        <p class="lead mb-4">As a second year history major at UCR, I have a lot of experience regarding history and my other academic courses. Firstly, I will discuss my past courses and how they helped with my understanding of history. When I was a Freshman I completed a course called Honors World History. I received an A in the class and as a result, I developed a deep understanding of the World outside the United States. After this I took a course called AP United States History. I received an A- in the class but grew to deeply appreciate how much minorities have contributed to the nation.After I took this course, I then began my senior year to take a course called AP European history. This course was very insightful and was very important to me because I was able to learn about my favorite type of history. Specifically, I was able to pass all my exams with hundreds and received an A+ as a final grade. This class was significant because it also taught me how history can often be biased and how we have to understand how people write and talk about history as a subject. The final course I took in high school was AP World History my senior year. What was interesting about AP world history was the fact that it was a self study course. I had to set aside my own time to complete and submit assignments for this course. I have of course done this and received an A+. The course was somewhat difficult but it taught me how we must look at the specific narratives of events and how they can be changed over time. After high school, I went to the University California Riverside. The very first class I took for my history major was The Historian as a Detective. Once more I got an A in the course. This course was challenging as my first college course, but I was able to learn how to learn history at the college level and to apply college level writing to my historical analysis. Furthermore I was able to learn about ancient Greece and hell they had a complex Society of advanced law and medicine. Lastly, the more recent course that I have completed was called  Catherine the Great. This course was very interesting as it was a newly added course to the UCR registration module. When I took this course I had some trouble with the material. I however was not ready to give up and worked hard to get a great grade. I regularly met with my professor and went to meet with my teaching assistant. I was able to get help with my writing and succeed. And as a result of their assistance, I began to fully grasp new concepts. The new concepts became easier to understand and I was able to effectively write about them in my essays. Eventually I had to study for the final exam which was new for me in college but I kept studying. I received an A+ on the final exam and received an overall A in the class. The course was significant for two reasons. One, it taught me to have a positive mindset when encountering challenging concepts and to utilize resources to overcome such challenges. Additionally, this class taught me to understand the nuances of Russian history and how they could be applied today.
<br><br>

        Another important thing that I believe I should disclose with regards to my own experiences is my other academic achievements. Beginning in the fourth grade, I always wanted to achieve outside the field of history so I could be a very well-rounded person. I did this by entering a PTA contest at my elementary school. In the contest I had to write an essay about diversity and how old is applied to people in real life. I was unsure about doing the essay but I did it anyway. I Wrote an Essay called Being "Different is Cool". I am proud of doing it because I won a national award. The writing of my essay was a difficult task as I struggled with writing. However, with help from my mom and my teachers, I was able to thoroughly write out my paper. Writing my essay allowed me to explore riding outside my interest in relating to people in the real world. However, with help from my mom and my teachers, I was able to thoroughly write out my paper. Writing my essay allowed me to explore riding outside my interest in relating to people in the real world. A few years later when I was in eighth grade, I had another opportunity to shine outside the field of history. I received an academic outstanding award for excellent grades. And more specifically, I received a 3.8 GPA average and got a certificate as a result. The significance of this lies behind the fact that Iâ€™ve worked very hard to get an adequate GPA and devoted much of my time in doing so. Also the certificate I received tied into my love of history as it was signed by President Obama himself. I was so happy I called everyone I knew and they congratulated me. I knew I was going to get recognition but I didnâ€™t think it would be from the president himself. After a few years I took a break from large projects like these and focused on High School. At the end of High School however, I took up the chance for an amazing opportunity. I took three AP tests my senior year to enter the College Board competition for excellence. The three tests I took for this competition were AP Art History, AP World History and AP European history. To stay for the exams I had to stay up some nights until midnight to complete them. When the day arrived, I took all three exams. I felt nervous after the exams but I knew I did well. A few months went by and I still kept studying the subjects so I would know them in the future. After a while the scores came out on collegeboard.com. I looked up my results and was shocked. I got all 5/5 on the exams and was so happy. I received a scholar with honor award along with $500 in the mail. These subjects weâ€™re related to history but weâ€™re outside my main courses. Regardless, I'll set my mind toward achieving perfection and get it. <br><br>

        Finally, I will now begin to talk about my travels and how they have benefited me professionally. When I was 16, I traveled to France. In France I stayed in the cities of Leon and Paris. In Leon, I researched Roman catholic cultural history and French popular culture. In my studies, I found interesting things I would use in the future. For example, I spoke to a professional historian who showed me important study encyclopedies that would aid my construction of detailed bibliographies. I would also visit the heart church which conveyed themes of not only religion but also astronomy and culture. I meant, the research was a bit challenging but I completed it as it were but a simple task. After I completed my studies in Leon, I then traveled to Paris. In Paris I visited the Eiffel tower, the French national Museum of popular culture and Versailles. I evaluated and analyzed different mediums of art and how they were perceived by their respective contemporary cultures. I used Wikipedia and Google to look at zoomed in images of the larger art pieces. This was no doubt challenging but through intensive reading I was able to complete my journal regarding French popular culture. The trip was overall great and I also got to meet a lot of new people and friends. I am sure one day I will return and continue my studies here. The other location I am proud to say I have visited and completed research is Geneva Switzerland. I traveled here when I was 19 and came with my family and a few friends. Here I was a part of the Jesuit program of learning which taught Medieval European History. In addition, I would attend both Catholic and protestant church services two develop a more nuanced understanding of church history. I however did not like this experience as much as the first one for a few main reasons. First it was a lot less individual and I was forced to work with other people. It was exciting to work with other people but many of them had a poor work ethic and I had to be the leader in the group. I was still successful but it was very time-consuming for me to do this particular task. Secondly because the services were often in Latin or French I had trouble understanding them. Because I could really understand them I had to stay after and ask questions as to why certain material applied in some circumstances and not others. Finally, unlike the first trip I did not have the opportunity to go to multiple places so I had fewer things to compare and contrast when writing about historical evolution and how it changed over time. Although there were some upsides as well. For one I had my family with me which I did not have on the first trip. They treated me to many places and even helped me with some of my papers. Additionally I was more free to hang out with friends and compare notes. Finally I saved up money and was able to spend it on more resources for research. Overall, I am happy that I participated in the study abroad programs because they helped me understand history in a new way.
